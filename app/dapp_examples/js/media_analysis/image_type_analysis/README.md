# Adam BC DApp Demo Example - Image Dimensions Analysis

This demo example shows how to build a DApp that can analyse the formats of images contained inside a photo directory in relation to their dimensions (height and width), calculating the area (width x height) occupied by each image. The aim is to identify which image formats overall have a larger area (height x width) and which have the smallest dimensions.

## How to run the DApp

Copy and paste all the contents of this folder into the 'app' folder.

Install the dependencies by running;

_npm install_

Go to settings and initialize the app.

Start the app by running;

_npm start_
