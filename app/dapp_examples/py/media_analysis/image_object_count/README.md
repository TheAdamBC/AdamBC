This demo example shows how to build a DApp that can count and rank the number of objects appearing inside an image.

## How to run the DApp

(NOTICE: To run this DApp, you must download the pre-trained YOLO weight file (237 MB). Get it here: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights. Also download the YOLO configuration file, yolov3.cfg, from https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo, and the COCO dataset name classifications file, coco.names, from https://cocodataset.org/#download)

Open the Command Line Terminal and type the command below (AppName being the name of the app you created).

Go to settings and initialize the app.

ReStart the app by running;
