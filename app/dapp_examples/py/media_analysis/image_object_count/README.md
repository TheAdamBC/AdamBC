# Adam BC DApp Demo Example - Image Object Appearance Count

This demo example shows how to build a DApp that can count and rank the number of objects appearing inside an image.

## How to run the DApp

(NOTICE: To run this DApp, you must download the pre-trained YOLO weight file (237 MB). Get it here: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights. Also download the YOLO configuration file, yolov3.cfg, from https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg, and the COCO dataset name classifications file, coco.names, from https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names. Then go to your DApp's folder and update the `App.py` dataset configuration variables `classes_names` and `net_yolo` to reflect where the dataset files are located.)

Open the Command Line Terminal and type the command below (AppName being the name of the app you created).

_Adam start AppName_

Go to settings and initialize the app.

ReStart the app by running;

_npm start_
