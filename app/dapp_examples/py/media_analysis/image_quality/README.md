# Adam BC DApp Demo Example - Image Quality Analysis (Image_Area/Image_size)

This demo example shows how to build a DApp that can estimate the quality of images in a file directory (We'll consider image quality as calculating the area of an image divided by its size).

## How to run the DApp

Open the Command Line Terminal and type the command below (AppName being the name of the app you created).

_Adam start AppName_

Go to settings and initialize the app.

ReStart the app by running;

_npm start_
