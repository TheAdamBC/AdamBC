# Adam BC DApp Demo Example - Image Receipt Analysis

This demo example shows how to build a DApp that can read an image receipt and identify items purchased and their prices, and ultimately the total amount spent.

## How to run the DApp

(NOTICE: To run this DApp, you must have Tesseract installed on your computer. Follow installation procedure here: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki. Then go to your DApp's folder and update the `App.py` pytesseract configuration variable `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd` to reflect where the tesseract files are located.)

Open the Command Line Terminal and type the command below (AppName being the name of the app you created).

_Adam start AppName_

Go to settings and initialize the app.

ReStart the app by running;

_npm start_
